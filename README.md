# About AOCL-Cryptography

**AOCL-Cryptography** is a library consisting of basic cryptographic functions optimized and tuned for AMD Zen™ based microarchitecture. This library provides a unified solution for Cryptographic routines such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption/decryption routines (CFB, CTR, CBC, CCM, GCM, OFB, SIV, XTS), Chacha20 Stream Cipher routines, Chacha20-Poly1305, SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) routines (SHA2, SHA3, SHAKE), Message Authentication Code (CMAC, HMAC, Poly1305 MAC), RNG, ECDH (Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman), RSA Encrypt/Decrypt and Sign/Verify Functions.

INSTALLATION
- For building and installation, please refer to the file [Build.md](./BUILD.md)
