
# Welcome to AOCL-Crypto

**AOCL-Crypto** is a library consisting of basic cryptographic functions optimized and tuned for AMD Zenâ„¢ based microarchitecture. This library provides a unified solution for Cryptographic routines such as AES Cipher ( CFB, CTR, CBC, CCM, GCM, OFB, SIV, XTS ), SHA Digest ( SHA2, SHA3, SHAKE ), Message Authentication Code ( CMAC, HMAC ), Elliptical Curve ( ecdhx25519 ), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman ( Public key Encrypt, private key decrypt ) etc ...

## Introduction

<b> AOCL Crypto </b> supports a dynamic dispatcher feature that executes the most optimal function variant implemented using Function Multi-versioning thereby offering a single optimized library portable across different x86 CPU architectures. 
AOCL Crypto framework is developed in C / C++ for Unix and Windows based systems. A test suite is provided for validation and performance benchmarking for the supported Ciphers, Digest and MAC APIs. The test suite also supports the benchmarking of IPP and Openssl different methods like AES cryptographic encryption / decryption, SHA2, SHA3 and other algorithms. Below are details of AOCL Crypto APIs and Supports
