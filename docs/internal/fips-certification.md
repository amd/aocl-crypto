# FIPS Certification
## What is FIPS
FIPS stands for Federal Information Processing Standards, is a publication
series of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). FIPS 140-2 is a
mandatory standard for protection of sensitive and valuable data.

Intended for improving utilization and management of computer and related
telecommunications systems in the Federal government.

## FIPS 140-2: SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULES

Specifies security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module
utilized within a security system. Protection of a cryptographic module within a
security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of
the information protected by the module.

The standard provides 4 level of security
 - Level 1
 - Level 2
 - Level 3
 - Level 4
 
Security requirement cover areas related to the secure design and implementation
of a cryptographic module.

The CMVP (Cryptographic Module Validation Program) validates modules to
FIPS:140-2 and other cryptography based standards. The CMVP is a joint effort
between NIST and the CSE(Communications Security Establishment).
