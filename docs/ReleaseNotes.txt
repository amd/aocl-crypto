AOCL Crypto - Release Notes - AOCL version 4.1
----------------------------------------------

AOCL Crypto Contents
--------------------
AOCL-Crypto is a library consisting of basic cryptographic functions
optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture. This library has multiple
implementations of different cryptographic algorithms which is given below: 
-- AES cryptographic encryption / decryption routines
-- SHA2, SHA3 Digest routines.
-- MAC (Cipher and Hash based) routines
-- ECDH x25519 Key exchange functions
-- RSA Encrypt/Decrypt functions.

Highlights of AOCL Crypto version 4.1
--------------------------------------
-- AES CCM encrypt/decrypt routines
-- Improvements in AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt routines for zen architecture
-- Improved SHA3 digest routines including SHAKE128 and 256 schemes
-- HMAC SHA2 and SHA3 routines
-- AES CMAC routines for key sizes (128, 192, and 256)
-- AES SIV routines
-- ECDH x25519 key exchange functions: Generate Public Key and Compute Secret Key
-- RSA Functions: Encrypt Text with public key and Decrypt with private key
    (Note: Only non-padded mode is supported in 4.1 release.)
-- Dynamic dispatch on different architectures support (using AOCL-Utils library)
-- Windows support
