AOCL Cryptography - Release Notes - AOCL version 4.2.1
------------------------------------------------------

AOCL Crypto Contents
--------------------
AOCL Cryptography is a library consisting of basic cryptographic functions
optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture. This library has multiple
implementations of different cryptographic algorithms which is given below: 
-- AES cryptographic encryption / decryption routines
-- SHA2, SHA3 Digest routines.
-- MAC (Cipher and Hash based) routines
-- ECDH x25519 Key exchange functions
-- RSA Encrypt/Decrypt and Sign/Verify functions.
-- Chacha20 stream cipher functions.
-- Poly1305 MAC functions.
-- Chacha20Poly1305 routines.
