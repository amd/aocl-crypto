AOCL Cryptography - Release Notes - AOCL version 5.0.1
------------------------------------------------------
AOCL Crypto Contents
--------------------
AOCL Cryptography is a library consisting of basic cryptographic functions
optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture. This library has multiple
implementations of different cryptographic algorithms which are given below:
-- AES cryptographic encryption / decryption routines.
-- SHA2, SHA3 Digest routines.
-- MAC (Cipher and Hash based) routines.
-- ECDH x25519 Key exchange functions.
-- RSA Encrypt/Decrypt and Sign/Verify functions.
-- Chacha20 stream cipher functions.
-- Poly1305 MAC functions.
-- Chacha20Poly1305 routines.


Highlights of AOCL Crypto version 5.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Performance improvements in SHA3.
- Performance improvements in AES-GCM for real-world benchmarks (WRK, ApacheBench, etc).
    - Performance drop with AES-GCM is expected in Micro-benchmarks such as OpenSSL Speed.
- OpenSSL Provider support for SHA3 and SHAKE.
 
- Bug fixes and improvements in OpenSSL provider dispatch for RSA and Ciphers.
- Coverity high and majority of medium and low severity defects fixed.
 
- Improvements and enhancements in test and benchmarks.
- Added multi-init benchmark support for AEAD Ciphers.
 
- Added CMake preset config files.
- Runtime forcing of CPUID / arch code path support using aocl-utils.
- Debug logging support in CAPIs and Provider APIs.
 
- Known limitations:
    - AES Ciphers, RSA and EC algorithms are not supported in pre-AVX2 architectures.
    - OpenSSL Provider dispatch for RSA works only if runtime OpenSSL version is the same as the version used to compile the compat binary.
       (Tested OpenSSL versions are: 3.1.3 through 3.3.0)
    - Performance drop with AES-GCM is expected in Micro-benchmarks such as OpenSSL Speed.
